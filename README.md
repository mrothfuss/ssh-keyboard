# ssh-keyboard
Turn an SSH connection into a USB keyboard! This is ideal for sharing a keyboard with a linux computer that is not running an X11 server.

## Usage:
1. SSH a linux computer
2. Run sshkeyboard as root
3. Begin typing

## Notes:
Not all keys have been implemented, I've only added what I've needed (printable ASCII)

This small program uses the US keyboard layout
